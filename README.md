# README #

This repository is for a 2D game I'm currently developing as a hobby.

I'm using GLFW for the platform layer, OpenGL to render the sprites, GLEW to load OpenGL functions, and SOIL2 to load textures.

With this project I'm trying to learn about game engine architecture and development, and more specifically about the [Data Oriented Design](https://github.com/taylor001/data-oriented-design) programming philosophy.

### Progress ###

It is still extremely early in development, but so far I have the following:

+ An Entity Handle system based on http://bitsquid.blogspot.com.co/2014/08/building-data-oriented-entity-system.html and http://gamesfromwithin.com/managing-data-relationships.
+ Transform component manager.
+ Sprite component manager.
+ Logging system.
+ Custom assertions that can log a message on failure.

At this point this is all it can do:
